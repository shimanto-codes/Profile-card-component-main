## 💡 What I learned

While building this project I learned:

- How to use multiple background images or pseudo-elements (`::before`) for decorative patterns.  
- How to control `z-index` properly so that the profile image stays above the background.  
- Importance of clean and semantic HTML structure.  

---

## 🤔 Challenges

The most challenging part was managing the background images and aligning them correctly.  
I also had to carefully adjust **z-index** to make sure the profile image appears above the background pattern.

## 👀 Continued development

In the future, I want to focus more on:

- Improving responsiveness for very small screens.  
- Experimenting with **CSS Grid** for layout.  
- Adding hover effects or animations for better UI.
